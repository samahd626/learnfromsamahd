## Introduction

Hello, My name is samahd. I'm a Software developer. This is my first blog post and I'll love to tell you about what you'll find here. Enjoy.





## What I will be Posting about

### 1. JavaScript

Right now my favorite language is JavaScript and I will be be talking about it a lot on this blog.  

**What is JavaScript**

JavaScript is the language of the browser and it is often abbreviated as JS. JavaScript is a **Programming Language** for the Web. JavaScript can update and change both **HTML** and **CSS.** JavaScript can **calculate**, **manipulate** and **validate** data. Learn more about this language in upcoming posts. I will also be writing about some of it's frameworks like **React**, **React Native**, **Vue JS**, etc.

*sample code: Hello world in JS*

```javascript
document.write("Hello world!");
```

### 2. PHP

My favorite back-end language.

**What is PHP**

**PHP** stands for **Hypertext Processor** and yeah the **P** stands for PHP. PHP is a widely-used, open source scripting language. PHP scripts are executed on the server that is PHP is a server side language. PHP is free to download and use. It is used by big companies like Facebook, WordPress, etc. It is easy enough to be a beginner's first server side language though I would not recommend that. Learn why in my Next post.ü§ì

*sample code: hello world in php*

```php
<?php
echo "Hello world";
?>
```

### 3. Python

The Latest

**What is Python**

Python is an **interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language** with dynamic semantics. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed. Python can be used to build desktop apps, write back-end code, even create mobile apps though I won't recommend that.

*sample code: hello world in python*

```python
print("Hello world")
```

### 4. Golang

My dreams of working at Google

**What is Golang**

Go or **GoLang**, as it is called, is a robust system-level language **used for** programming across large-scale network servers and big distributed systems. **Golang** emerged as an alternative to C++ and Java for the app developers in the context of what Google needed for its network servers and distributed systems.

*sample code: hello world in Golang*

```go
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
    fmt.Println("hello world")
}
```

### 5. Typescript

My alternative to JS

**What is Typescript**

TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. The goal of **TypeScript** is to help catch mistakes early through a type system and to make JavaScript development more efficient.

*sample code: hello world in Typsescript*

```typescript
let message:string = "Hello World"
alert(message)
```

## **Conclusion**

This is a shortlist of what I'll be posting here as I will also be talking about development environment and tools like the **VSCode, Dockers, Git, Postman, NPM,** etc. I hope you've gotten an overview of what this blog is about. thanks for reading, If you have any problems please send me a feedback by clicking on the chat head or by sending an email: samahd626@gmail.com.
